"""
A Proof is a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the Prove-It
proof for a KnownTruth.  Each object represents a derivation step
(Assumption, ModusPonens, HypotheticalReasoning, Specialization,
or Generalization) and has references to other KnownTruths that
are directly required, each with its Proof.  In this way, the
Proof objects form a DAG.
