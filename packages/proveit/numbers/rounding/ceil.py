        'extracting' the integer component out from the Ceil() fxn).
        The idx_to_extract is the zero-based index of the item in the
        operands of an Add(a, b, …, n) expression to attempt to extract.
        Assumptions may be necessary to deduce necessary conditions
        (for example, that x_int actually is an integer) for the

        This method is utilized by the doReducedSimplification() method

        For the case where the entire operand x is itself an integer,
        see the roundingElimination() method.

        This works only if the operand x is an instance of the Add
        class at its outermost level, e.g. x = Add(a, b, …, n). The
        operands of that Add class can be other things, but the
        extraction is guaranteed to work only if the inner operands
        a, b, etc., are simple.
