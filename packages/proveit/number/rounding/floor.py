                       analogous methods in Add and Exp classes. May
                       need to be renamed.

        For the trivial case where the operand is an integer,
        derive and return this Floor expression equated with the
        operand itself. Assumptions may be necessary to deduce
        necessary conditions for the simplification.
        For the case where the operand is of the form (real + int),
        derive and return this Floor expression equated with
        Round(real) + int.
        CONSIDER ADDING A RECURSIVE COMPONENT to allow further 
        simplfication, for example for Floor(real + int + int).

        This works only if the operand x is an instance of the Add

        operands of that Add class can be other things, but the
