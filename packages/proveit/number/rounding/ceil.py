        CONSIDER ADDING A RECURSIVE COMPONENT to allow further

        operands of an Add(a, b, …, n) expression to attempt to extract.

        This works only if the operand x is an instance of the Add

        operands of that Add class can be other things, but the

        a, b, etc., are simple.
