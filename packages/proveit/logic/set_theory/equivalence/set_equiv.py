class SetEquiv(TransitiveRelation):
    '''
    Class to capture the membership equivalence of 2 sets A and B.
    SetEquiv(A, B) is a claim that all elements of A are also elements
    of B and vice-versa. The SetEquiv relation uses the congruence symbol
    to distinguish the SetEquiv claim from the stronger claim that A = B.
    The class was initially established using the class Equals as an
    archetype.
