    Defines an enumerated set (i.e. a set with explicitly-listed
    elements). For example, one could use Set(one, two, three) to
    produce the enumerated set {1, 2, 3} or Set(a, b, a) to produce
    the enumerated set {a, b, a}. Although repeated elements can be
    specified and will appear in output expressions, the Set is
    interpreted as a set and not a multiset --- thus, e.g., we have
    {a, b, a} = {a, b} and the cardinality of an enumerated Set such
    as {a, b, a} should be the cardinality of the underlying support
    {a, b}.
