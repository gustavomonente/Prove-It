# Contributing to Prove-It

<font size=3>

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to Prove-It,
a Python- and Jupiter Notebook-based theorem-proving assistant.


The Prove-It project is still under development and not quite ready for
public contributions yet. The intent is to begin accepting public
contributions to the project in the near future, which will allow
contributors to help expand Prove-It's theory packages, broaden
Prove-It's functionality, and benefit from Prove-It's adaptability to
individual interests and needs.

In the meantime, potential contributors are gratefully acknowledged and
encouraged to browse through the broader project documentation and
source files, such as the draft of the
[introductory paper](https://github.com/PyProveIt/Prove-It/blob/master/ProveIt_Introduction.pdf), a variety of
[tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/PyProveIt/Prove-It/tree/master/tutorial),
or the brief
[readme.md](https://github.com/PyProveIt/Prove-It/blob/master/readme.md)
with information about downloading and installing Prove-It. Also feel
encouraged to contact the primary developer, Wayne Witzel, at
wwitzel@sandia.gov with questions.
